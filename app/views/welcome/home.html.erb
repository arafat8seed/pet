<h1>Dog behavior</h1>
<p>Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses of</br>
   individuals or groups of domestic dogs to internal and external</br>
   stimuli.</br>
   [1] It has been shaped by millennia of contact with </br>
   humans and their lifestyles. As a result of this physical and</br>
    social evolution, dogs, more than any other species,</br>
    have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with</br>
    humans and they are uniquely attuned to their behaviors.</br>

    [2] Behavioral scientists have uncovered a wide range of </br>
    social-cognitiveabilities in the domestic dog.</p>
